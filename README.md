# Apex Legends App ( 1 / 100 Apps )
- 3 Main purpose of this Project
1. To practice and fully understand the "reusability" meaning behind Components in React Framework.
2. I believe that a good FE developer is capable of replicating any component on any website hence why I'm doing this. 
3. My goal for this year is to make 100 web-apps by end of this year and hopefully acquire important FE knowledge along the way.
