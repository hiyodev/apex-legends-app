# Apex Legends App ( 1 / 50 Apps )
- Why did I make this?
1. To practice and fully understand the "reusability" meaning behind Components in React Framework.
2. I believe that a good Frontend Developer is capable of replicating any component on any website hence I'm doing this to get better at replicating components and ensuring reuseability.
3. My goal for this year is to make 50 web-apps by end of this year and hopefully acquire important FE knowledge along the way. This project was created in May 2023 and is the 1/50 project.
